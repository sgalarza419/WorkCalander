# workCalendar

In this assignment I was required to build a daily calendar to take in input for each hour of the work day.  I used rows with a text input box 
and save button to store the notes in local storage.  I used the .moment() methods in order for the website to tell the current time and used if statement
to change the color of the background of the row based on the time.  A for statement was used to store and project notes onto the webpage.
